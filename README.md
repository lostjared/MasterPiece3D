# MasterPiece3D

A older project for a 3D Puzzle game similar to a old game  Acid Drop
for Atari 2600. The project is a older one and requires SDL 1.2, libmx and libpng/zlib are in the path
the project is configured for. For me that is /opt/local so I use

./configure --prefix=/opt/local

make


libmx can be found here: https://github.com/lostjared/libmx

Controls:

Left Arrow - Move Blocks Left

Right Arrow - Move Blocks Right

Down Arrow - Move Blocks Down

A - Swap colors of blocks

Z - Rotate X +

X - Rotate X -

C - Rotate Y +

V - Rotate Y -

D - Rotate Z +

F - Rotate Z -

Line up 3 blocks of the same color either going horizontal, vertical, or diagnoal to clear them
and gain points.
