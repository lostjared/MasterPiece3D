# MasterPiece3D

A older project for a 3D Puzzle game similar to a old game  Acid Drop
for Atari 2600. The project is a older one and requires SDL 1.2, libmx and libpng/zlib are in the path
the project is configured for. For me that is /opt/local so I use

./configure --prefix=/opt/local

make


libmx can be found here: https://github.com/lostjared/libmx
